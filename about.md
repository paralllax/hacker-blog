Hello, 

My name is Karston. I am a Linux Systems Administrator currently employed at Rackspace. This is more or less just a blog about random technical things, or things I may do in my homelab. If you would like me to write a guide about anything in particular, feel free to let me know, I very well may. 

If you would like, feel free to drop by my other social media. I am not always active, but I'll do my best to keep up.
